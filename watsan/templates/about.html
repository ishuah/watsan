				<h4 class="">WATSAN Portal: Kibera</h4>
				<p>WATSAN Portal: Kibera is a project led by Kounkuey Design Initiative (KDI) and in partnership with Spatial Collective and Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company to develop and test an online information platform that creates access to municipal water and sanitation data for non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), and entrepreneurial individuals who wish to implement water and sanitation (WATSAN) projects in Kibera, the largest informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. This tool will allow users to more efficiently and effectively launch high-quality WATSAN projects in Kibera, thus increasing the total number of residents with access to safe water and sanitation. WATSAN Portal: Kibera is a decision-making tool that fills a critical gap in the WATSAN project delivery process by making geo-referenced data on water and sewerage infrastructure instantly available, accessible, and usable. Its overall objective is to simplify the WATSAN project implementation process and open access to municipal data; thereby increasing the total number of residents with access to decent water and sanitation in this impoverished area. This website was developed as a pilot for the two villages of Kibera: Gatwekera and Laini Saba.

				<h4 class="">Kounkuey Design Initiative</h4>
				<p>Kounkuey Design Initiative is a non-profit design and community development practice made up of architects, landscape architects, urban planners, engineers, artists, and community organizers. We partner with people living in poverty to design and implement solutions that transform their communities and improve their quality of life. We know that poverty is economic, social, and environmental. To address these challenges, we build low-cost, high-impact projects called Productive Public Spaces (PPS)— underutilized spaces, like vacant lots or dumping sites, transformed into community hubs—that simultaneously improve people, place, and environment. PPSs provide shared amenities (sanitation facilities, playgrounds etc.), offer social programs (skill trainings, recreational activities etc.), and provide economic opportunity (small businesses in the space) all in one location.
				</p>
				<p>Since the organization’s founding in 2006, KDI has worked with residents in Africa, Latin America, and the United States to create functional yet beautiful public spaces in which communities can thrive. We are currently working on nine PPSs, strategically selected and designed to form both human and physical networks that, when taken together, address larger, regional challenges, like water pollution, unemployment, and disenfranchisement. Our public spaces have won numerous awards for their aesthetic contributions, design innovation, and participatory design process by notable institutions such as The Rockefeller Foundation, Ashoka Changemakers, American Express, Annenberg Alchemy, Smithsonian Institute, and Echoing Green.

Their feedback in user testing workshops allowed us to create an interface that responds to the user’s needs. The Advisory Committee will provide on-going support to the WATSAN Portal: Kibera as the site develops.
